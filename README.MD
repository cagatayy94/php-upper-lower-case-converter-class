This class wroted for Turkish string upper-lower conversation problems. 

İt contains 4 functions:

1-) upperCase          -> it will change all chars to upper case in the string no matter what they are upper or lower case.
2-) lowerCase          -> it will change all chars to lowercase in the string no matter what they are upper or lower case.
3-) upperFirst         -> it will change only first char to uppercase in the string no matter what it is upper or lower case. And also it will changes another chars to lower case.
4-) upperAllWordsFirst -> it will change all all words first char to upper case no matter what they are upper or lower case. And also it will changes another chars in the words to lower case.

This class will help to change all string conversation.

str_raplace function changes them also but it changes only American way

For example: char "i" changes to "I" but in Turkish it is not correct it is wrong conversation
     
For all of these I wrote that Class.
